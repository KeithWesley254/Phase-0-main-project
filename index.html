                <h4>Developer trainee & Youtuber</h4>
                <p>
                    Gaming has always been a passion of mine since I saw the playstation. I started on consoles but quickly transitioned to Pc gaming where I fell in love with games like Halo, midtown madness, Age of Empires etc.<br>
<br>Gaming inspired me to join the tech world to give back to the awesome community hence Software Development and Youtube Gaming.

                <p>I have played many games before steam was a thing. I played a lot of games hard core, invested a lot of hours chasing leaderboard ranks.<br>
                    <br>I have won local tournaments that involved shooting games as well as team play such as Paladins, Call of duty etc.<br>
                    <br>Mmos like Black Desert Online is where I finally ended up because of the vast content and flexibility. It is truly my metaverse.
